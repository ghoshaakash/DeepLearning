\chapter{Distributed Systems}

\section{Introduction}

We first look at why we would want to have a distributed system. The main reasons include:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Parallelism
    \item Fault Tolerance : We want our system to work even if there is partial failure in the system. 
    \item The system is physically separated
    \item For security reasons/ when you want to have an isolated system
\end{enumerate}
