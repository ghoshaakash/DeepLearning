\chapter*{Preface}
 
This preface contains two things: Why the fuck am I writing a manuscript and what the fuck this manuscript will be about. Mainly so that I fucking remember what I set out to do.\\

In 2016, you could have gone through a basic ML course on coursera and would have got a job. Today, a basic course on coursera doesn't even give you an interview. Most of that is because a few bastards at deep mind realised that attention is indeed all that you need. Along with some GPUs and shit ton money. During the time of writing, I have completed the begainner courses and know how to run an SGD. But anyone with three brain cell would know that is not even close to what is needed and anyone with four will know there is no clear cut documentation to understand what is to be done to bridge the gap between random forests, and vanilla Adam implementation on TensorFlow to winning Kaggle  comps or actually pushing the boundary of what's been done. So I will over the course of two months attempt to get up to speed on what the world is doing, esp in the fields where CNN is not used. For some reason, CNNs make me gag. And by the end of this whole ordeal, I better get something or I will fucking kill myself.  \\

P.S: Again, at the time of writing, MAMBA, an alternative to transformers were released. With some luck, we will ride this fucking wave to the end. \\\\
